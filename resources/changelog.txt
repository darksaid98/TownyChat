v0.1:
	- Initial release
v0.2:
	- Fixed players entering regex fields in chat crashing {msg}.
	- changed PLAYER_CHAT event to run earlier so we triger before other chat plugins.
	  If players are using chat modes we need to run first to cancel the chat event for other plugins.
v0.3:
	- TownyChat now only enables itself if Towny successfully starts.
	- Fixed missing {} around modplayername.
v0.4:
	- Fixed custom channel chat not showing in the console.
v0.5:
	- Added auto modes for chat.
	  Type '/tc' to set town chat mode. All text typed from then on will be sent to town chat.
	  While in a chat mode you can still talk in other channels by using the channel commands eg. '/nc hi'.
	  While in a chat mode you can talk in global chat with '/g text here'.
	  to clear all chat modes '/g'.
	- Added a new permission node for global chat ('/g') of 'towny.chat.global'.
	- Added {worldname} as an accepted entry.
	- Fixed '/g' mode to add formatting.
v0.6:
	- Changed global chat to pass through bukkits chat process instead of our own (allows other plugins to see it again).
v0.7:
	- Added support for Essentials mute and ignore features. Players on ignore will still be seen in town and nation chat.
	- Added craftIRC 3.1 support
	
	  Add a channel tag of 'admin' to the
	  receiving channel in the craftIRC config.
	  
	  Disable Auto paths and add the following to the 'paths:' section

	    - source: 'minecraft'
	      target: 'admin'
	      formatting:
	        chat: '%message%'
	        
	    - source: 'admin'     # These are endpoint tags
	      target: 'minecraft'    #
	      formatting:
	        chat: '%foreground%[%red%%ircPrefix%%sender%%foreground%] %message%'
v0.8:
	- Fixed {townformatted} and {nationformatted} to display correctly.
	- Updated to use new per world channel formats.
v0.9:
	- TownyChat now passes player chat to Dynmap.
v0.10:
	- Code rewrite for new code locations in Towny.
	- Added a spam filter so players can only send one message every two seconds.
	- Added the ability to restrict channel ranges.
	
	  All custom channels (not town or nation) can now have an extra value
	  appended to signify a range limit on chat.
	  
	  -1 = no limits
	   0 = same world only
	  any positive value = limited range (blocks) in the same world.
	  
	  eg. - /g,,,towny.chat.global,-1
	        or a local channel that covers 100 blocks range
	        /l,&f[local],&f,towny.chat.local,100
	        
	- Added a new mode '/towny spy', or '/res set mode spy'.
	  This requires you have the permission node 'towny.chat.spy' and be using TownyChat.
	  If you toggle this mode on you will be able to see all town/nation/global, and all custom channel chat.
	- If a player doesn't have the 'towny.chat.global' permission node, any open chat will pass through for any other plugins to handle.
v0.11:
	- Fixed channel tag for the global channel.
	- Fixed range test trying to cross worlds.
v0.12:
	- Major rewrite to move all channel handling into TownyChat.
	- All chat channels are now defined in their own file 'Channels.yml' found in the Towny/Settings folder.
	- Range limits can now be applied to town and nation chat.
	- You can create two identical channels, one with a range limit and one without. The player will use whichever they have permission for.
	- towny_default_modes now uses the full chat channel name. To allow use of the default channel it would be towny_default_modes: 'general'
	- Moved ALL chat settings to 'ChatConfig.yml' found in the Towny/Settings folder.
v0.13:
	- Fixed channel modes when defaulting to a global channel not to place you in one of your own (Lonely spam).

	- Updated for the new Bukkit Event system.
v0.16:
	- Lowered event priorities to HIGH to allow other plugins the chance to beat us to the event and cancel.
	- Fixed Op's with no default mode set using local chat. It will now try global, then world, then local in it's search order.
	- Added a new command '/townychat reload'.
	- spam_time now accepts smaller values (eg. 0.5).
v0.17:
	- If a player has no permissions for any channel but we are still set to modify chat, remove the channelTag and msgcolour entries.
	- Fix Spam timer to work in milliseconds so values of 0.5 actually work.
	- Fix craftIRC hook to not spam console with an invalid number format error if the wrong version is detected.
	- Add support for our updated HeroicDeath jar (hopefully someone will take over support for heroic Death now it's updated).
v0.18:
	- Added craftIRC channel tag support. A new entry per channel will allow you to set the endpoint tags for all channels to craftIRC (craftIRCTag: 'admin').

v0.25:
	- Update to account for the refactoring in Towny.
v0.26:
	- Throw a "fake" PlayerChatEvent which will allow TownyChat to have much increased compatibility with other plugins (dumptruckman).
v0.27:
	- Cancel our own event after all other plugins have had a bash at the formatting.
v0.28:
	- Forget using any fake events and move to setting recipients. We should now be compatible with just about every other chat modifying plugin there is.

	- add a new chatconfig.yml option:
		- modify_chat.alone_message: (default: false) - If true any player who speaks in a channel in which he cannot be heard, either by being along in the channel or out-of-range of another player in his chat channel, that player will see a message saying they cannot be heard.     
v0.44:
    - add a /ch list command to list what channels a player is currently listening to. Courtesy of Yaiyan.
v0.45:
    - Add chatconfig.yml option for modifying the 'no one can hear you' message.

      - Provides the ability to use bold, italics, etc in chat.

      - This means that new config nodes will be automatically added (just like in Towny.)
      - pre-0.52 chatconfig files will load but will be slightly out of order. 
      - It is recommended that you let TownyChat make a brand new chatconfig.yml
        - stop your server.
        - rename your chatconfig.yml to oldchatconfig.yml and let town.
        - start your server. 
        - compare the two chatconfigs and when your new chatconfig.yml is configured save it and use '/townychat reload'.
      - The worlds section of the chatconfig will not auto-generate until the modify_chat.enable setting is set to true.
        - If you do not see a worlds section and want to use per-world chat, set the modify_chat.enable setting to true and use '/townychat reload'.
    - All strings have been made translate-able. Failure to use Towny Version 0.92.0.10 or newer will mean you see no messages.

v0.60:
  - A more-thorough fix for TC still not respecting the cancelling of chat.

    - Has its own channel_format in the chatconfig.yml.
    - Your channels.yml will need to have an Alliance channel added.
    - Default channels.yml is:
    alliance:
        commands: [ac]
        type: ALLIANCE
        channeltag: '&f[&2AC&f]'
        messagecolour: '&a'
        permission: 'towny.chat.alliance'
        range: '-1'
v0.63:
  - Change: spam_time has been moved from the chatconfig.yml, to the channels.yml
    - You do not have to set a spam_time for each channel, only the ones you want limited.
    - setting spam_time: '0.5' in your general channel will make the global channel behave as normal.
    - default channels.yml has spam_time: '0.5' set for general, town, nation and alliance channels; remaining channels have no spam_time set.
    - in your chatconfig.yml you can remove the "spam_time: '0.5'" line before or after updating. 
  - New Permission Node: townychat.spam.bypass
    - Defaults to ops.
    - Bypasses spam check.
v0.64:
  - Removed "[Towny] Modes set: " line seen when a player changes channels.
v0.65:
  - Altered behaviour:
    - Previously using the channel command for the channel you're already speaking in would move you to the next default channel, 
      or if non was found, the next global channel.
    - Ex: While being in townchat you use "/tc" you could find yourself in globalchat.
    - Now you will be told you're already in the channel you just used the command to enter into.
  - Fixed: GLOBAL channelTypes (default: general and local channels) are no longer formatted by TownyChat if modify_chat.enabled is false.
    - DEFAULT, TOWN, NATION & ALLIANCE types are still formatted by Towny when modify_chat.enable is false.
